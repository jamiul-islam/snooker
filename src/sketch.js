// ----------------------------------------COMMENTARY ----------------------------------------------------

//I designed this snooker app with the idea of emulating the aesthetic of the image given in the coursework instructions.
//I created the gameTable with p5js using their rect and ellipse functions, while making the cushions, and the balls with matter.js
//using their snookerBodies function. The cue is not a physical cue as seen in snooker, but instead follows a more slingshot style of release,
//this was just another way for me to add uniqueness to my app, however using matter.js, I was able to create collision events only when,
//the cue ball was released. Furthermore, I also found it more intuitive to have a purely mouse based cue, this means that the placement,
// loading, and releasing of the cue is based on the state of the mouse. Functionally, this works by creating a constraint in the middle
//of the cue ball, and removing that constraint when the mouse is released, once the cue ball is no longer moving, create a new constraint
//at the new position of the cue ball.

//For the game mechanics, I used an object-oriented style of programming with constructor functions for the gameTable,
//ball, my extension, etc. For the pockets, I detected falling simply by tracking the y position of each ball, as the cushions would
// stop them from leaving the gameTable at certain heights, and the only way to breach that threshold would be through the p5.js generated
// pockets that don't collide with the matter.js bodies. In my ballOrganizer object I tracked things such as fouls, the target ball,
// as well as all the logic for when a ball collides or falls. I also included a function for the cushion where it lights up when making
// contact with the cue ball.

//For my extensions I implemented three things, starting from the least original I implemented a scoreboard, with both scoring additions
// from the balls being pocketed, but also deductions from foul shots, as well as preventing points from being added if a foul occurred.
// Next, I added a stopwatch that counts down from 10 minutes. If either the stopwatch runs out, or the player clears the gameTable, they can press
// ‘r’ to restart. Finally, I also included “superpowers”. This is under its own object with functions that activate, deactivate,
//and assign their usage through the creation of a button with the p5.js DOM. Some of these powers include, increasing the power of the
// cue by multiplying its mass, making the balls smaller, doubling the points of each ball, and randomly aligning balls to the front of
// each pocket. These powers were my way of giving an arcade feel to an otherwise very professional and technical game. I believe this
//to be unique and “has not been seen in snooker gaming before”, as it is a manipulation of the game’s physics and rules in a way unable
// to be done in real life, and not appropriate for snooker applications which are usually attempting to
//recreate the reality of the game.
