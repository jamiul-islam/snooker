/*
 * --------Game Initialization--------
 *
 * The game begins when the user presses one of three numeric choices on the keyboard: 1, 2, or 3,
 * each corresponding to a different ball arrangement:
 *
 *   - Ordered (1): The balls are arranged in a pyramid configuration.
 *   - Partial (2): Only the red balls are randomly scattered across the table.
 *   - Unordered (3): All balls are randomly distributed across the table.
 *
 * For random ball distribution, the application utilizes the random function for the unordered mode and the noise function for the partial mode.
 * The game starts only when the player positions the cue ball inside the D-line.
 *
 * --------Ball Properties and Organization--------
 *
 * Each ball in the simulation is endowed with appropriate restitution and friction properties to emulate realistic bouncing and slowing effects.
 * Balls are managed within an array, allowing dynamic interaction and removal. The ballOrganizer.js class includes the detectImpact() function,
 * which evaluates collisions between the cue ball and other balls on the table.
 *
 * --------Cue Stick Mechanics--------
 *
 * The cue stick in the simulation is modeled as an elastic band with dynamic constraints. When the cue ball is struck,
 * it moves in various directions based on the applied force. The physics engine ensures that excessive force can propel the cue ball off the table.
 * Error-checking mechanisms are in place to prompt the user to reposition the cue ball within the D-line if it exits the table or falls into one of the six pockets.
 *
 * --------Cushion Physics and Visual Features--------
 *
 * Physics on the table cushions is implemented by assigning appropriate restitution values to simulate bounciness.
 * Additionally, a unique feature was added where the cue ball changes color from dark green to light green upon hitting the cushion,
 * providing a visual indication of collision. This feature, although was primarily for testing, remains in the final version due to its appealing aesthetics.
 *
 * --------Extra Features--------
 *
 * I developed extra functionalities and implemented four unique features using button interactions that challenged and required me to extensively depend on the Matter.js documentation throughout the past weeks:
 *
 *   - Jumbo Ball: Increases the weight of the cue ball by five times upon clicking the button.
 *   - Shrink Size: Reduces the size of all balls, excluding the cue ball, to approximately 60% of their original size.
 *   - 3X Score: Triples the player's score.
 *   - To Pockets: Randomly arranges six red balls at the six pockets of the table iteratively when the button is clicked.
 *
 * --------FACTORY PATTERN AND OOP FEATURES--------
 *
 * In this project I've used OOP features like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism were applied extensively.
 * Encapsulation helped protect the internal state of objects, exposing only what was necessary.
 * Inheritance allowed for a hierarchy of classes, so shared behaviors among different ball types were efficiently managed.
 * Polymorphism enabled dynamic method overriding, allowing each ball type to behave uniquely when needed.
